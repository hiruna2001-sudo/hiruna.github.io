### Requirements Engineering

Requirements engineering is a broad domain that focuses on being the connector between modeling, analysis, design, and construction. It is the process that defines, identifies, manages, and develops requirements in a software engineering design process. This process uses tools, methods, and principles to describe the systemâ€™s behavior and the constraints that come along with it.

> Requirements engineering is the most important part every business must follow.
